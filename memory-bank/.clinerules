## Important Notes
- Use symbolic links for file sharing between dev and test environments
- Follow MQL5 include conventions: 
  - Custom includes: `#include <MyProjects/Path/File.mqh>`
  - Standard includes: `#include <Trade/Trade.mqh>`
- Always validate against MQL5 constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility during development
- Always request the user compiles files, never attempt to compile a file
