**Objective:** To develop a fully functional MT5 dashboard indicator through an iterative process of LLM-driven development and human-led testing.

**Development Methodology:** 
Agile/Iterative, with a focus on discrete, testable components.

**Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.

**Development Guidance**:
- We will work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Handling Include files
```text
// For custom includes #include <MyProjects/Trade/RiskManager.mqh> #include "..\Includes\MyProjects\Indicators\RSI.mqh"

// For MT5 standard includes (not in the repo) #include <Trade/Trade.mqh>
```

- The SlopeStrength indicator file can be found C:\Users\calmo\OneDrive\Documents\Development\mt5-projects\MQL5\Indicators\MyProjects\SuperSlope
