**Objective:** To develop a fully functional MT5 dashboard indicator through an iterative process of LLM-driven development and human-led testing.  We are now in Phase 2 of the project - Development of the View (CRenderer Class).

**Development Methodology:** 
Agile/Iterative, with a focus on discrete, testable components.

**Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.

**Development Rules**:
- We will work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Request clarification if something is not clear.
- Handling Include files
    - For custom includes #include <MyProjects/Trade/RiskManager.mqh> #include "..\Includes\MyProjects\Indicators\RSI.mqh"
    - For MT5 standard includes (not in the repo) #include <Trade/Trade.mqh>

- The SuperSlopeDashboard indicator file can be found C:\Users\calmo\OneDrive\Documents\Development\mt5-projects\MQL5\Indicators\MyProjects\SuperSlopeDashboard

### Current Task

Iteration 2.3: Unit Test Creation
*   **Task 2.3.1 (LLM):** Write a standalone test script (`Test_Renderer.mq5`) that:
    *   Includes `CRenderer.mqh`.
    *   Creates a static, hardcoded data structure (e.g., an array of 5 lists, each containing 2-3 dummy symbol data).
    *   Creates an instance of `CRenderer` and calls its `Draw` method with this fake data.
*   **Deliverable:** `Test_Renderer.mq5`
