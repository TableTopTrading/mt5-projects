	- Hit a snag in testing - and have had to remove the .ini file manager that I found in the code library
		- Root Cause Identified
			- The original CIniFile class was failing because it relied on Windows API functions (`WritePrivateProfileStringW`/`GetPrivateProfileStringW`) that have compatibility issues within MetaTrader's sandboxed environment.
		- Solution Implemented
			- Created Custom Configuration Handler (CConfigHandler.mqh)
			- Updated CEquityCurveController
- Sprint 2.8: Resource Cleanup Guarantees
