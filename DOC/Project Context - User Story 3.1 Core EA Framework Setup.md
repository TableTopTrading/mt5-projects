## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 

### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.

### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
#### Sprint 1.1
- __Standard MQL5 EA properties__ - Copyright, version, and strict mode directives
- __Necessary header files__ - Corrected include paths to use "Include" (singular) instead of "Includes" based on the test system structure
- __Basic event handlers__ - OnInit(), OnDeinit(), and OnTick() implemented
- __Global object declarations__ - CDataManager object instantiated with proper initialization
- __Placeholder functionality__ - Basic signal generation and execution logic that will be replaced with proper components later
- __Compilation-ready structure__ - All include paths corrected to match the actual file structure
#### Sprint 1.2
The implementation includes:
- __Created Directory Structure__: Created `MQL5/Includes/MyProjects/EquityCurve/` directory
- __Complete Header File__: Created `CEquityCurveController.mqh` with:
	- Private members: `m_initialized` (bool), `m_log_path` (string), `m_output_path` (string)
	- Constructor and destructor implementations
	- All required public methods: `Initialize()`, `ValidateAccountType()`, `SetupDirectories()`, `ConfigureLogging()`, `Cleanup()`
	- Getter method: `IsInitialized()` with proper const qualifier
	- Include guards to prevent multiple inclusions
- __MQL5 Compliance__: The class follows MQL5 conventions with proper access modifiers and method signatures
- __Error Handling__: Includes comprehensive error handling with appropriate return types
- __Documentation__: Contains proper class documentation and comments

The class is designed as a controller for managing Equity Curve EA initialization and setup, including account validation, directory setup, logging configuration, and cleanup operations. The implementation provides a solid foundation that can be integrated with the existing EA skeleton once the standard MQL5 includes are available in the compilation environment.

### Current Task - Sprint 1.3

Add Account Type Validation Logic
**Activities:**
- [ ] Implement ValidateAccountType() method in CEquityCurveController
- [ ] Use AccountInfoInteger(ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE) to check account type
- [ ] Add logic to allow only ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_DEMO and Strategy Tester
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling with clear messages
- [ ] Log validation results for audit trail
- [ ] Test with different account types to ensure restrictions work
