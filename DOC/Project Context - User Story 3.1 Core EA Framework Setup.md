## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.
### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.
### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
#### Sprint 1: Core Framework Foundation
#### Sprint 2.1 Standard Includes Integration and Compilation Fix
1. __Standard Includes Integration__: Uncommented and integrated all 4 standard MQL5 libraries:
	   - `<Trade/Trade.mqh>` - For trade execution functionality
	   - `<Trade/AccountInfo.mqh>` - For account validation and information
	   - `<Trade/SymbolInfo.mqh>` - For symbol information and market data
	   - `<Trade/PositionInfo.mqh>` - For position management and tracking
2. __Controller Updates__: Updated CEquityCurveController.mqh to include the necessary AccountInfo header for proper account validation functionality.
3. __Compilation Fixes__:
	   - Implemented a proper `IsNewBar()` function using `iTime()` for new bar detection
	   - Resolved compilation issues with placeholder code
	   - The AccountInfoInteger calls in ValidateAccountType() are now fully functional
4. __Memory Bank Updated__: Enhanced the technical design documentation with details of the Sprint 2.1 enhancements, including implementation status and next steps enabled by the standard includes integration.
##### Key Enhancements
- __Account Validation__: Now fully functional with proper access to account type detection
- __New Bar Detection__: Proper implementation using standard library functions
- __Architecture Readiness__: Foundation laid for future components (CTradeManager, CPositionTracker, file operations)
- __Clean Codebase__: All compilation warnings and placeholder issues resolved
#### Sprint 2.2: Directory Creation Implementation for the Equity Curve Signal EA. 
1. __Files/File.mqh Integration__: This was not required and instead used mql5 built in functions.
2. __Directory Creation Implementation__: Completely rewrote the `SetupDirectories()` method to actually create directories instead of just setting path strings
3. __Comprehensive Error Handling__: Implemented robust error handling with:
	   - Directory existence checks using `FileIsExist()` before creation attempts
	   - Detailed error logging with specific error codes from `GetLastError()`
	   - Individual error handling for each directory creation attempt
4. __Enhanced Logging__: Updated logging to provide actual creation results with success/failure status for each directory
5. __Three Directory Creation__: Implemented creation of all required directories:
	   - `EquityCurveSignals\Logs`
	   - `EquityCurveSignals\Output`
	   - `EquityCurveSignals\Configuration`
6. __Helper Function__: Created `CreateDirectoryWithCheck()` utility function that handles existence checks and error reporting
7. __Memory Bank Updated__: Enhanced technical documentation to reflect the directory management implementation status
#### Sprint 2.3 
1. __File Handle Management__: Added private member variables for file handle management including:
	   - `m_log_file_handle` - File handle for logging operations
	   - `m_current_log_file` - Current log filename tracking
	   - `m_max_log_size` - Maximum log file size (10MB) for rotation
2. __Enhanced ConfigureLogging() Method__:
	   - Creates timestamped log files (EquityCurve_YYYYMMDD.log)
	   - Writes comprehensive log headers with account information
	   - Implements proper error handling for file operations
	   - Uses FILE_COMMON flag for shared access across terminals
3. __File-Based Logging Methods__:
	   - Updated LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() to write to files
	   - Added precise timestamping with millisecond precision
	   - Maintains fallback to Print() for error conditions
	   - Includes automatic log rotation checks before each write
4. __Log Rotation System__:
	   - Size-based rotation (10MB maximum file size)
	   - Automatic file closure and renaming with timestamps
	   - Seamless recreation of new log files after rotation
	   - Comprehensive error reporting for rotation failures
5. __Enhanced Cleanup() Method__:
	   - Proper file handle closure with error checking
	   - Resource cleanup and state reset
	   - Comprehensive logging of cleanup operations
6. __Utility Methods__:
	   - CreateDirectoryWithCheck() for robust directory creation
	   - CheckLogRotation() for automatic file management
	   - Enhanced LogInitializationParameters() with detailed system info
7. __Testing Infrastructure__:
	   - Created Test_File_Logging.mq5 script for verification
	   - Comprehensive test coverage for all log types
	   - Multiple message generation to test rotation logic
