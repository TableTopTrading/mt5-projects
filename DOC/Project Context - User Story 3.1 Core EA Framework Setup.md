## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 

### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.

### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
#### Sprint 1.1
- __Standard MQL5 EA properties__ - Copyright, version, and strict mode directives
- __Necessary header files__ - Corrected include paths to use "Include" (singular) instead of "Includes" based on the test system structure
- __Basic event handlers__ - OnInit(), OnDeinit(), and OnTick() implemented
- __Global object declarations__ - CDataManager object instantiated with proper initialization
- __Placeholder functionality__ - Basic signal generation and execution logic that will be replaced with proper components later
- __Compilation-ready structure__ - All include paths corrected to match the actual file structure
#### Sprint 1.2
The implementation includes:
- __Created Directory Structure__: Created `MQL5/Includes/MyProjects/EquityCurve/` directory
- __Complete Header File__: Created `CEquityCurveController.mqh` with:
	- Private members: `m_initialized` (bool), `m_log_path` (string), `m_output_path` (string)
	- Constructor and destructor implementations
	- All required public methods: `Initialize()`, `ValidateAccountType()`, `SetupDirectories()`, `ConfigureLogging()`, `Cleanup()`
	- Getter method: `IsInitialized()` with proper const qualifier
	- Include guards to prevent multiple inclusions
- __MQL5 Compliance__: The class follows MQL5 conventions with proper access modifiers and method signatures
- __Error Handling__: Includes comprehensive error handling with appropriate return types
- __Documentation__: Contains proper class documentation and comments

The class is designed as a controller for managing Equity Curve EA initialization and setup, including account validation, directory setup, logging configuration, and cleanup operations. The implementation provides a solid foundation that can be integrated with the existing EA skeleton once the standard MQL5 includes are available in the compilation environment.
#### Spring 1.3 
1. __Strategy Tester Detection__: Added `MQLInfoInteger(MQL_TESTER)` check that allows immediate validation when running in Strategy Tester mode.
2. __Restricted Account Types__:
	   - Now only allows ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_DEMO for live trading
	   - Explicitly rejects ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_REAL with clear error message
	   - Rejects ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_CONTEST with specific error message
	   - Handles unknown account types gracefully
3. __Enhanced Error Handling__:
	   - Clear, descriptive error messages for each rejection scenario
	   - Success messages for approved account types
	   - Comprehensive logging for audit trail purposes
4. __Removed Unnecessary Logic__:
	   - Removed the balance check since it wasn't required for account type validation
	   - Simplified the validation flow for better maintainability
##### Validation Logic:
- __Allowed__: Strategy Tester (MQL_TESTER) and Demo accounts (ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_DEMO)
- __Rejected__: Real accounts (ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_REAL), Contest accounts (ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_CONTEST), and any unknown account types
#### Sprint 1.4
1. __Log File Handle Management__: Added `m_log_file` member to track log file handles
2. __Enhanced ConfigureLogging() Method__: Simplified to work without standard includes while maintaining the structure for future implementation
3. __Log Level Methods__:
	   - `LogInfo(string message)` - for informational messages with [INFO] prefix
	   - `LogWarning(string message)` - for warning messages with [WARN] prefix
	   - `LogError(string message)` - for error messages with [ERROR] prefix
4. __LogInitializationParameters() Method__: Created to record initialization parameters with proper structure ready for detailed logging
5. __Error Handling__: Implemented fallback to standard Print() when file logging is not available, ensuring robustness
6. __Integration__: The logging framework is properly integrated with the existing directory setup and follows the project's architecture
#### Sprint 1.5
1. __Updated Directory Paths__: Changed from "EquityCurve\\" to "EquityCurveSignals\\" for all paths
	   - Log path: "EquityCurveSignals\Logs\\"
	   - Output path: "EquityCurveSignals\Output\\"
	   - Configuration path: "EquityCurveSignals\Configuration\\"
2. __Enhanced Logging Integration__: Replaced Print statements with proper logging methods:
	   - Used LogInfo() for successful operations and status messages
	   - Used LogError() for error conditions (ready for file-based implementation)
	   - Maintains consistent audit trail format
3. __Comprehensive Structure__: The implementation maintains the complete directory structure ready for full implementation when standard MQL5 includes become available
4. __Error Handling Ready__: The framework is in place for robust error checking and reporting once file operations are enabled
### Sprint 1.6: Integration Phase
1. __Added Controller Include__: Added `#include <MyProjects\EquityCurve\CEquityCurveController.mqh>` using proper angle bracket syntax
2. __Global Controller Instance__: Created `CEquityCurveController controller;` as a global object
3. __Updated OnInit()__:
	   - Added controller initialization as the first step
	   - Controller handles account validation, directory setup, and logging
	   - Maintains data manager initialization for backward compatibility
4. __Updated OnDeinit()__: Added `controller.Cleanup()` for proper resource cleanup
5. __Removed Problematic Code__:
	   - Removed placeholder signal processing functions that caused compilation errors
	   - Simplified ProcessSignals() to a basic placeholder
	   - Simplified IsNewBar() to avoid compilation issues with missing includes
6. __Maintained Structure__: Kept the overall EA structure intact while removing compilation blockers
#### Current State:

- The EA should now compile without the previous placeholder code conflicts
- The CEquityCurveController is properly integrated and will handle:
  - Account type validation (allows Strategy Tester/demo, rejects real accounts)
  - Directory structure setup (EquityCurveSignals/Logs/, /Output/, /Configuration/)
  - Logging system initialization
  - Proper cleanup on deinitialization

### Testing:

- __Strategy Tester__: Should initialize successfully with proper logging
- __Demo Account__: Should initialize successfully with proper validation
- __Real Account__: Should fail initialization with clear error message
- __Directory Creation__: Logging should show directory setup process
- __Cleanup__: Proper resource cleanup should occur on deinitialization

All tests passed.
