## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.
### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.
### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

#### Sprint 2.5 - Parameter Validation and Logging for the Equity Curve Signal EA. Here's what was accomplished:
1. Comprehensive Parameter Validation
	- Added `ValidateInputParameters()` function that validates:
		- __SymbolList__: Format validation, empty checks, and symbol existence verification using `SymbolInfoInteger(symbol, SYMBOL_SELECT)`
		- __StrongThreshold/WeakThreshold__: Range validation (0.0-1.0) and logical validation (StrongThreshold > WeakThreshold)
		- __PositionSize__: Positive value validation
		- __UpdateFrequency__: Minimum reasonable value (â‰¥1 second)
2. Enhanced LogInitializationParameters()
	- Updated the controller method to accept and log all EA input parameters:
		- Now includes SymbolList, StrongThreshold, WeakThreshold, PositionSize, and UpdateFrequency in the log output
		- Maintains comprehensive system configuration logging
		- Includes validation status reporting for account, directories, and logging
3. Integration with Existing Framework
	- Parameter validation occurs early in `OnInit()` before any other initialization
	- Validation failures return `INIT_FAILED` with descriptive error messages
	- Successful validation triggers enhanced parameter logging
4. Error Handling
	- Uses existing error handling framework with descriptive error messages
	- Graceful degradation - prevents EA initialization with invalid parameters
	- Comprehensive error reporting for all validation failures
#### Sprint 2.6 - Configuration File Support for the Equity Curve Signal EA. Here's what was accomplished:
1. __CIniFile Library Integration__: Integrated Batohov's CIniFile class for robust INI file handling using Windows API calls
2. __Configuration Management Methods__: Added to CEquityCurveController:
   - `LoadConfiguration()` - Loads parameters from INI file with default fallbacks
   - `SaveConfiguration()` - Saves current settings to INI file
   - `ReloadConfiguration()` - Reloads configuration without EA restart
3. __Configuration Priority Strategy__: EA loads parameters in this order:
   - Configuration file values (if exists and valid)
   - EA input parameters (fallback)
   - Hardcoded defaults (safety net)
4. __Configuration File Structure__: Uses standard INI format:
5. __Enhanced Error Handling__: Comprehensive error reporting for configuration operations with integration into existing logging system

#### Sprint 2.7 Live Configuration Reload Implementation Plan
1. Added Private Member Variable
	- Added `m_last_config_modify_time` to track the last known modification time of the configuration file
2. Implemented CheckConfigFileModified() Method
	- Created a robust method that uses `FileGetInteger()` with `FILE_MODIFY_DATE` to detect configuration file changes
	- Includes comprehensive error handling with descriptive error messages
	- Handles edge cases like missing files and first-time initialization
	- Provides detailed logging of modification detection events
3. Integrated into Initialization
	- The method automatically records the initial modification time during the first check
	- Properly handles the case where no configuration file exists yet
4. Added to Main Processing Loop
	- Integrated the file modification check into the `OnTick()` function in EquityCurveSignalEA.mq5
	- The check runs on every update frequency or new bar formation
	- Currently logs detection events with a TODO comment for future automatic reload implementation
5. Added Hotkey Input Parameter
	- Added `input int ReloadConfigKey = 115;` for manual configuration reload (F4 key by default)
	- The parameter is documented with a clear comment explaining its purpose
6. Implemented OnChartEvent() Handler
	- Created a comprehensive chart event handler that detects key press events
	- Specifically listens for `CHARTEVENT_KEYDOWN` events
	- Checks if the pressed key matches the configured hotkey (F4 by default)
	- Triggers manual reload when the hotkey is pressed
7. Added ForceReloadConfiguration() Method
	- Implemented a public method that can be called manually for configuration reload
	- Uses the existing `ReloadConfiguration()` method from the controller
	- Includes comprehensive validation of reloaded parameters
	- Provides detailed logging of the reload process and results
	- Includes error handling for failed reload attempts
8. Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging
	- All reload operations are logged with timestamps and detailed messages
	- Validation failures are clearly reported with specific error messages
	- Success messages include the reloaded parameter values for verification
9. Enhanced Validation System
	- The existing `ValidateInputParameters()` method remains as the core validation logic
	- Added comprehensive parameter comparison and change detection in the new validation system
10. Added ValidateConfigurationChanges() Method
	- __Comprehensive Comparison__: Compares current vs new parameter values in detail
	- __Change Detection__: Logs specific changes for each parameter that gets modified
	- __Basic Validation__: Leverages the existing `ValidateInputParameters()` for fundamental validation
	- __Detailed Logging__: Provides clear messages about what changed and what remained the same
11. Implemented Robust Rollback Mechanism
	- __State Preservation__: Stores current parameter values before attempting reload
	- __Automatic Rollback__: If validation fails, automatically reverts to previous values
	- __Error Reporting__: Clear error messages indicate when rollback occurs and why
	- __Data Integrity__: Ensures the EA never operates with invalid configuration values
12. Enhanced ForceReloadConfiguration() Method
	- __State Management__: Now properly stores current values before reload attempts
	- __Integrated Validation__: Uses the new validation system before applying changes
	- __Rollback Integration__: Seamlessly integrates with the rollback mechanism
	- __Comprehensive Logging__: Detailed progress reporting throughout the reload process
		- Validation Process Flow
			1. __Store Current State__: Preserve all current parameter values
			2. __Reload from File__: Attempt to load new configuration from file
			3. __Basic Validation__: Validate new parameters meet fundamental requirements
			4. __Change Comparison__: Compare new values with current values and log changes
			5. __Apply or Rollback__: Apply new values if valid, or rollback to previous values if invalid
			6. __Report Results__: Provide detailed feedback about the operation outcome
13. Added Reentrancy Prevention Flag
	- Added `bool g_is_reloading_config = false;` global variable to track reload state
	- The flag prevents concurrent reload attempts within the single-threaded MQL5 environment
14. Implemented Thread-Safe Reload Checking
	- Added check at the beginning of `ForceReloadConfiguration()` to detect concurrent reload attempts
	- If a reload is already in progress, the method logs a warning and returns early
	- This prevents multiple simultaneous reload operations that could cause state inconsistencies
15. Added Comprehensive Error Handling
	- Clear warning message: "Configuration reload already in progress - skipping duplicate request"
	- The system gracefully handles duplicate reload requests without crashing or producing errors
	- Users receive immediate feedback about the reload status
16. Proper Resource Management
	- The reload flag is set to `true` at the start of the reload operation
	- The flag is reset to `false` at the end of the operation (both success and error paths)
	- This ensures the system always returns to a usable state
17. Enhanced Existing Test Configuration Script
	- __Updated `Test_Configuration.mq5`__ with two new test functions:
		- `TestFileModificationDetection()`: Tests the file modification timestamp checking system
		  - `TestConfigurationValidation()`: Tests comprehensive parameter validation rules
18. Created New Live Reload Test Script
	- __Created `Test_LiveReload.mq5`__ with four comprehensive test scenarios:
		- Test 1: Manual Trigger Simulation
			- Simulates manual reload via `ForceReloadConfiguration()`
			- Tests the complete reload workflow from file reading to parameter validation
			- Verifies that reload operations complete successfully
		- Test 2: Error Handling for Invalid Configurations
			- Tests error handling with deliberately invalid configuration values:
				- Non-existent symbols
				- Out-of-range thresholds (1.5)
				- Invalid threshold relationships (Weak > Strong)
				- Negative position sizes
				- Invalid update frequencies
			- Verifies that invalid configurations are properly detected and rejected
		- Test 3: Concurrent Reload Prevention
			- Simulates the thread-safe reload prevention mechanism
			- Tests that concurrent reload attempts are properly blocked
			- Verifies the reentrancy protection logic works correctly
		- Test 4: Configuration Validation During Reload
			- Tests all validation scenarios with a comprehensive test matrix:
				  - Valid configuration (should pass)
				  - Empty symbol list (should fail)
				  - Invalid strong threshold (should fail)
				  - Weak threshold > Strong threshold (should fail)
				  - Negative position size (should fail)
				  - Invalid update frequency (should fail)
Hit a snag in testing - and have had to remove the .ini file manager that I found in the code library
##### Root Cause Identified

The original CIniFile class was failing because it relied on Windows API functions (`WritePrivateProfileStringW`/`GetPrivateProfileStringW`) that have compatibility issues within MetaTrader's sandboxed environment.

##### Solution Implemented

1. Created Custom Configuration Handler (CConfigHandler.mqh)
	- __Native MQL5 Implementation__: Uses MQL5's built-in file functions (`FileOpen`, `FileWrite`, `FileRead`) instead of Windows API
	- __Full Feature Parity__: Supports all the same operations as CIniFile (Read/Write String, Integer, Double, Bool)
	- __Enhanced Reliability__: Works within MetaTrader's file system constraints
	- __Better Error Handling__: Comprehensive error checking and logging
2. Updated CEquityCurveController
	- __Replaced CIniFile with CConfigHandler__: Updated all configuration methods to use the new handler
	- __Fixed Path Handling__: Ensured consistent use of `FILE_COMMON` flag for shared file access
	- __Maintained Compatibility__: All method signatures remain the same
3. Key Technical Improvements
	- __Eliminated Windows API Dependencies__: No more external function calls that fail in MetaTrader
	- __Proper File Location__: Files are stored in `MQL5/Files/` directory using `FILE_COMMON` flag
	- __Export/Import Ready__: Configuration files will be included when the indicator is compiled and exported
	- __Better Debugging__: Enhanced error messages and verification steps

## Expected Results

The configuration tests should now pass because:

1. __SaveConfiguration__ will successfully write values to files
2. __LoadConfiguration__ will correctly read saved values (not just return defaults)
3. __ReloadConfiguration__ will work consistently
4. __File modification detection__ will function properly

The solution addresses the core requirement of producing an exportable indicator with configuration that can be consumed by a separate EA, using reliable MQL5 native file operations instead of problematic Windows API calls.

### Current Task -  ## Sprint 2.7: Live Configuration Reload Implementation Plan


Done
### Testing
- Test_Configuration compiles 
	- Several errors have been identified and need to be fixed.  This is a critcal part of the system

### 6. Documentation Updates

- Update user guide with reload instructions and hotkey information
- Add comments in code for the new functionality
- Document the reload process in the memory bank

---
## Next Task
## Sprint 2.8: Resource Cleanup Guarantees Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Cleanup Method

- Review current `Cleanup()` method and ensure it releases all resources
- Add explicit cleanup for the CIniFile object if needed (check if it requires manual disposal)
- Ensure all file handles are properly closed, not just the log file

### 2. Destructor Improvements

- Enhance the destructor to call `Cleanup()` if not already done
- Add logging in destructor to track object destruction
- Ensure proper order of cleanup operations

### 3. Resource Leak Detection

- Implement resource tracking counters for file handles and memory allocations
- Add debug methods to report open resources
- Integrate with logging system to report potential leaks

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

- Test cleanup during normal deinitialization (`OnDeinit`)
- Test cleanup during error conditions and forced termination
- Verify no open file handles using external tools or MQL5 functions
- Test memory usage before and after cleanup

### 5. Audit Logging

- Enhance cleanup logging to include details of resources released
- Log cleanup operations with timestamps and success status
- Ensure cleanup logs are written even if file logging is unavailable

### 6. Integration with Existing Framework

- Ensure cleanup works with all currently implemented components
- Coordinate with future components to maintain cleanup standards
- Update technical documentation with cleanup procedures

## Implementation Priority

I recommend implementing Sprint 2.7 first since it builds directly on the existing configuration system, followed by Sprint 2.8 to ensure robust resource management.

## Technical Considerations

- For file modification detection, use `FileGetInteger()` with `FILE_MODIFY_DATE` which is efficient and non-blocking
- For thread safety, since MQL5 is single-threaded, simple flags should suffice to prevent reentrancy
- The CIniFile library appears to be stateless for read operations, so reloads should be safe
- Resource cleanup should focus on the log file handle and any potential resources from CIniFile
