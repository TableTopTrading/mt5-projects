## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.

### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.

### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
#### Sprint 1

##### Current State:
- The EA compiles
- The CEquityCurveController is properly integrated and will handle:
  - Account type validation (allows Strategy Tester/demo, rejects real accounts)
  - Directory structure setup (EquityCurveSignals/Logs/, /Output/, /Configuration/)
  - Logging system initialization
  - Proper cleanup on deinitialization

### Current Task - Sprint 2.1: Standard Includes Integration and Compilation Fix
- __Objective:__ Integrate MQL5 standard libraries and ensure clean compilation 
- __Activities:__
- [ ] Uncomment standard includes in EquityCurveSignalEA.mq5:
  - #include <Trade/Trade.mqh>
  - #include <Trade/AccountInfo.mqh>
  - #include <Trade/SymbolInfo.mqh>
  - #include <Trade/PositionInfo.mqh>
- [ ] Update CEquityCurveController.mqh to include necessary standard headers
- [ ] Remove any compilation errors caused by placeholder code
- [ ] Verify all components compile without warnings
- [ ] Test basic functionality in Strategy Tester
