## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.
### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.
### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
#### Sprint 1: Core Framework Foundation

#### Sprint 2.1 Standard Includes Integration and Compilation Fix
1. __Standard Includes Integration__: Uncommented and integrated all 4 standard MQL5 libraries:
	   - `<Trade/Trade.mqh>` - For trade execution functionality
	   - `<Trade/AccountInfo.mqh>` - For account validation and information
	   - `<Trade/SymbolInfo.mqh>` - For symbol information and market data
	   - `<Trade/PositionInfo.mqh>` - For position management and tracking
2. __Controller Updates__: Updated CEquityCurveController.mqh to include the necessary AccountInfo header for proper account validation functionality.
3. __Compilation Fixes__:
   - Implemented a proper `IsNewBar()` function using `iTime()` for new bar detection
   - Resolved compilation issues with placeholder code
   - The AccountInfoInteger calls in ValidateAccountType() are now fully functional
1. __Memory Bank Updated__: Enhanced the technical design documentation with details of the Sprint 2.1 enhancements, including implementation status and next steps enabled by the standard includes integration.
##### Key Enhancements
- __Account Validation__: Now fully functional with proper access to account type detection
- __New Bar Detection__: Proper implementation using standard library functions
- __Architecture Readiness__: Foundation laid for future components (CTradeManager, CPositionTracker, file operations)
- __Clean Codebase__: All compilation warnings and placeholder issues resolved

### Current Task - Sprint 2.2: Directory Creation Implementation
- __Objective:__ Implement actual directory creation with proper error handling 
- __Activities:__
- [ ] Modify SetupDirectories() method in CEquityCurveController to use FileCreateDirectory
- [ ] Create all required directories:
  - EquityCurveSignals\Logs\\
  - EquityCurveSignals\Output\\
  - EquityCurveSignals\Configuration\\
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for directory creation failures
- [ ] Implement directory existence checks before creation
- [ ] Log directory creation events with success/failure status
Human Tasks:
- [ ] Test directory creation in both Strategy Tester and demo accounts
- [ ] Verify directory permissions and accessibility
