## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.
### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.
### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

#### Sprint 2.4 Comprehensive Error Handling
1. __Error Code Definitions & Descriptive Messages__
	- Added custom error codes (ERROR_FILE_OPERATION, ERROR_DIRECTORY_CREATION, etc.)
	- Created `GetErrorDescription()` function that provides descriptive text for all standard MQL5 error codes
	- Enhanced all error messages to include both error code and descriptive text
2. __Enhanced Error Checking & Reporting__
	- Added comprehensive `GetLastError()` checking after all file operations (FileOpen, FileWrite, FileClose)
	- Improved error reporting for directory operations (FolderCreate)
	- Ensured consistent error message format: "Error [code]: [description]"
3. __Parameter Validation__
	- Added input validation to all public methods
	- Implemented NULL and empty string checks for method parameters
	- Methods now return false or skip operations gracefully instead of potentially crashing
4. __Error Logging Improvements__
	- Enhanced logging with detailed error context and descriptive messages
	- Maintained robust fallback mechanisms to Print() when file logging fails
	- All file operation errors now include file paths and operation details
#### Sprint 2.5 - Parameter Validation and Logging for the Equity Curve Signal EA. Here's what was accomplished:
1. Comprehensive Parameter Validation
	- Added `ValidateInputParameters()` function that validates:
		- __SymbolList__: Format validation, empty checks, and symbol existence verification using `SymbolInfoInteger(symbol, SYMBOL_SELECT)`
		- __StrongThreshold/WeakThreshold__: Range validation (0.0-1.0) and logical validation (StrongThreshold > WeakThreshold)
		- __PositionSize__: Positive value validation
		- __UpdateFrequency__: Minimum reasonable value (â‰¥1 second)
2. Enhanced LogInitializationParameters()
	- Updated the controller method to accept and log all EA input parameters:
		- Now includes SymbolList, StrongThreshold, WeakThreshold, PositionSize, and UpdateFrequency in the log output
		- Maintains comprehensive system configuration logging
		- Includes validation status reporting for account, directories, and logging
3. Integration with Existing Framework
	- Parameter validation occurs early in `OnInit()` before any other initialization
	- Validation failures return `INIT_FAILED` with descriptive error messages
	- Successful validation triggers enhanced parameter logging
4. Error Handling
	- Uses existing error handling framework with descriptive error messages
	- Graceful degradation - prevents EA initialization with invalid parameters
	- Comprehensive error reporting for all validation failures

#### Sprint 2.6 - Configuration File Support for the Equity Curve Signal EA. Here's what was accomplished:
1. __CIniFile Library Integration__: Integrated Batohov's CIniFile class for robust INI file handling using Windows API calls
2. __Configuration Management Methods__: Added to CEquityCurveController:
   - `LoadConfiguration()` - Loads parameters from INI file with default fallbacks
   - `SaveConfiguration()` - Saves current settings to INI file
   - `ReloadConfiguration()` - Reloads configuration without EA restart
3. __Configuration Priority Strategy__: EA loads parameters in this order:
   - Configuration file values (if exists and valid)
   - EA input parameters (fallback)
   - Hardcoded defaults (safety net)
4. __Configuration File Structure__: Uses standard INI format:
   ```ini
   [General]
   SymbolList=EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY
   StrongThreshold=0.7
   WeakThreshold=0.3
   PositionSize=0.1
   UpdateFrequency=60
   ```
5. __Enhanced Error Handling__: Comprehensive error reporting for configuration operations with integration into existing logging system
6. __Testing Infrastructure__: Created comprehensive test script (`Test_Configuration.mq5`) to verify all configuration functionality
