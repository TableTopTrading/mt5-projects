## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.
### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.
### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
#### Sprint 1: Core Framework Foundation

#### Sprint 2.1 Standard Includes Integration and Compilation Fix
1. __Standard Includes Integration__: Uncommented and integrated all 4 standard MQL5 libraries:
	   - `<Trade/Trade.mqh>` - For trade execution functionality
	   - `<Trade/AccountInfo.mqh>` - For account validation and information
	   - `<Trade/SymbolInfo.mqh>` - For symbol information and market data
	   - `<Trade/PositionInfo.mqh>` - For position management and tracking
2. __Controller Updates__: Updated CEquityCurveController.mqh to include the necessary AccountInfo header for proper account validation functionality.
3. __Compilation Fixes__:
	   - Implemented a proper `IsNewBar()` function using `iTime()` for new bar detection
	   - Resolved compilation issues with placeholder code
	   - The AccountInfoInteger calls in ValidateAccountType() are now fully functional
4. __Memory Bank Updated__: Enhanced the technical design documentation with details of the Sprint 2.1 enhancements, including implementation status and next steps enabled by the standard includes integration.
##### Key Enhancements
- __Account Validation__: Now fully functional with proper access to account type detection
- __New Bar Detection__: Proper implementation using standard library functions
- __Architecture Readiness__: Foundation laid for future components (CTradeManager, CPositionTracker, file operations)
- __Clean Codebase__: All compilation warnings and placeholder issues resolved
#### Sprint 2.2: Directory Creation Implementation for the Equity Curve Signal EA. 
1. __Files/File.mqh Integration__: Added the necessary include for file operations functionality
2. __Directory Creation Implementation__: Completely rewrote the `SetupDirectories()` method to actually create directories instead of just setting path strings
3. __Comprehensive Error Handling__: Implemented robust error handling with:
	   - Directory existence checks using `FileIsExist()` before creation attempts
	   - Detailed error logging with specific error codes from `GetLastError()`
	   - Individual error handling for each directory creation attempt
4. __Enhanced Logging__: Updated logging to provide actual creation results with success/failure status for each directory
5. __Three Directory Creation__: Implemented creation of all required directories:
	   - `EquityCurveSignals\Logs`
	   - `EquityCurveSignals\Output`
	   - `EquityCurveSignals\Configuration`
6. __Helper Function__: Created `CreateDirectoryWithCheck()` utility function that handles existence checks and error reporting
7. __Memory Bank Updated__: Enhanced technical documentation to reflect the directory management implementation status
##### Key Features Implemented
- __Smart Directory Creation__: Checks if directories already exist before attempting creation
- __Detailed Error Reporting__: Provides specific error codes when directory creation fails
- __Comprehensive Logging__: Logs both successful creations and failures with descriptive messages
- __Robust Error Handling__: Individual error handling for each directory with proper return values
- __Common File Area__: Uses `FILE_COMMON` flag for directory operations in the common files area

The directory creation system is now fully functional and ready for testing in both Strategy Tester and demo accounts. The implementation follows MQL5 best practices and provides comprehensive error handling and logging for audit trail purposes.
