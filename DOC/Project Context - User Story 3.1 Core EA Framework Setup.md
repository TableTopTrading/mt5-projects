## **Objective:** To setup the core EA Framework, for a MT5 EA 
Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.
### **Roles:**
*   **LLM (Developer):** Writes code for specified components based on detailed instructions and context.
*   **Human (Tester/Manager):** Provides context, defines tasks, runs tests, provides feedback, and conducts final acceptance testing.
### **Development Rules**:
- Consult memory bank when wider context is needed.
- Work on one file at a time.  If changes are needed to other files, stop and request confirmation first.
- Always review your plan to ensure that you are considering any MQL5 constraints.
- Always ask the user to compile files as symbolic links are used to share files between dev and test.
- Include Convention: 
    - Use angle brackets `< >` for all project includes
    - Paths should be relative to MQL5/Includes directory
    - Example: `#include <MyProjects\ComponentName\FileName.mqh>`

### Completed
- Sprint 1: Core Framework Foundation
- Sprint 2.1 Standard Includes Integration and Compilation Fix
- Sprint 2.2: Directory Creation Implementation for the Equity Curve Signal EA. 
- Sprint 2.3: File based logging
- Sprint 2.4 Comprehensive Error Handling
- Sprint 2.5 - Parameter Validation and Logging for the Equity Curve Signal EA.
- Sprint 2.6 - Configuration File Support for the Equity Curve Signal EA. 
- Sprint 2.7 Live Configuration Reload Implementation Plan
	- Hit a snag in testing - and have had to remove the .ini file manager that I found in the code library
		- Root Cause Identified
			- The original CIniFile class was failing because it relied on Windows API functions (`WritePrivateProfileStringW`/`GetPrivateProfileStringW`) that have compatibility issues within MetaTrader's sandboxed environment.
		- Solution Implemented
			- Created Custom Configuration Handler (CConfigHandler.mqh)
			- Updated CEquityCurveController

## Next Task
### Sprint 2.8: Resource Cleanup Guarantees
- __Objective:__ Ensure proper resource management and cleanup 
- __Activities:__
- [x] Enhance Cleanup() method to release all resources (file handles, memory)
- [x] Implement destructor improvements for proper object cleanup
- [x] Add resource leak detection and reporting
- [x] Test cleanup during normal deinitialization and error conditions
- [x] Verify no open file handles or memory leaks after EA removal
- [x] Log cleanup operations for audit purposes

## Sprint 2.8: Resource Cleanup Guarantees Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Cleanup Method

- Review current `Cleanup()` method and ensure it releases all resources
- Add explicit cleanup for the CIniFile object if needed (check if it requires manual disposal)
- Ensure all file handles are properly closed, not just the log file

### 2. Destructor Improvements

- Enhance the destructor to call `Cleanup()` if not already done
- Add logging in destructor to track object destruction
- Ensure proper order of cleanup operations

### 3. Resource Leak Detection

- Implement resource tracking counters for file handles and memory allocations
- Add debug methods to report open resources
- Integrate with logging system to report potential leaks

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

- Test cleanup during normal deinitialization (`OnDeinit`)
- Test cleanup during error conditions and forced termination
- Verify no open file handles using external tools or MQL5 functions
- Test memory usage before and after cleanup

### 5. Audit Logging

- Enhance cleanup logging to include details of resources released
- Log cleanup operations with timestamps and success status
- Ensure cleanup logs are written even if file logging is unavailable

### 6. Integration with Existing Framework

- Ensure cleanup works with all currently implemented components
- Coordinate with future components to maintain cleanup standards
- Update technical documentation with cleanup procedures
