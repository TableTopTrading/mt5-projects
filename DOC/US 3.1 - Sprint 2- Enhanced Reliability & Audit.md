Based on the template from Sprint 1, here's the detailed decomposition of Sprint 2 into discrete phases with implementation steps:
## Overview

Sprint 2 focuses on enhancing the reliability and audit capabilities of the Equity Curve Signal EA framework, building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1. This sprint will implement comprehensive error handling, parameter validation, resource cleanup, configuration support, and actual file-based operations.

## Task Breakdown

### Sprint 2.1: Standard Includes Integration and Compilation Fix
- __Objective:__ Integrate MQL5 standard libraries and ensure clean compilation 
- __Activities:__
- [x] Uncomment standard includes in EquityCurveSignalEA.mq5:
  - #include <Trade/Trade.mqh>
  - #include <Trade/AccountInfo.mqh>
  - #include <Trade/SymbolInfo.mqh>
  - #include <Trade/PositionInfo.mqh>
- [x] Update CEquityCurveController.mqh to include necessary standard headers
- [x] Remove any compilation errors caused by placeholder code
- [x] Verify all components compile without warnings
- [x] Test basic functionality in Strategy Tester

__Dependencies:__ None (builds on existing Sprint 1 foundation)

### Sprint 2.2: Directory Creation Implementation
- __Objective:__ Implement actual directory creation with proper error handling 
- __Activities:__
- [x] Modify SetupDirectories() method in CEquityCurveController to use FileCreateDirectory
- [x] Create all required directories:
  - EquityCurveSignals\Logs\\
  - EquityCurveSignals\Output\\
  - EquityCurveSignals\Configuration\\
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for directory creation failures
- [x] Implement directory existence checks before creation
- [x] Log directory creation events with success/failure status
- [x] Test directory creation in both Strategy Tester and demo accounts
- [x] Verify directory permissions and accessibility

__Dependencies:__ Sprint 2.1 completed (standard includes integrated)

### Sprint 2.3: File-Based Logging Implementation
- __Objective:__ Replace Print statements with actual file-based logging 
- __Activities:__
- [x] Implement file handle management in CEquityCurveController
- [x] Modify ConfigureLogging() to create and open log files
- [x] Update LogInfo(), LogWarning(), LogError() methods to write to files
- [x] Implement log rotation based on file size or time
- [x] Add timestamping to all log entries
- [x] Ensure proper file closing in Cleanup() method
- [x] Test logging functionality with various message types
- [x] Verify log files are created in the correct directory

__Dependencies:__ Sprint 2.2 completed (directories created)

### Sprint 2.4: Comprehensive Error Handling
- __Objective:__ Implement robust error handling throughout the codebase 
- __Activities:__
- [x] Add error code definitions and consistent error reporting format
- [ ] Implement try-catch mechanisms where appropriate for file operations
Dropped this requirement and used simpler, built in error handling
- [x] Enhance method return types to include error status
- [x] Add input parameter validation for all public methods
- [x] Create centralized error handling routines
- [x] Ensure all errors are logged with appropriate severity levels
- [x] Test error conditions to verify proper handling and reporting

__Dependencies:__ Sprint 2.3 completed (logging implemented)

### Sprint 2.5: Parameter Validation and Logging
- __Objective:__ Validate all EA input parameters and log initialization values 
- __Activities:__
- [x] Implement validation for SymbolList parameter (format, existence)
- [x] Add range checking for StrongThreshold and WeakThreshold (0.0-1.0)
- [x] Validate PositionSize (positive values)
- [x] Check UpdateFrequency (minimum reasonable value)
- [x] Update LogInitializationParameters() to log actual parameter values
- [x] Add parameter validation error messages and handling
- [x] Test with invalid parameters to ensure proper rejection
- [x] Verify all parameters are logged correctly during initialization

__Dependencies:__ Sprint 2.4 completed (error handling in place)

### Sprint 2.6: Configuration File Support
- __Objective:__ Implement configuration file management using INI format 
- __Activities:__
- [ ] Create configuration file structure in EquityCurveSignals\Configuration\\
- [ ] Implement INI file reading/writing functions
- [ ] Add configuration management to CEquityCurveController or separate class
- [ ] Support default values and configuration validation
- [ ] Log configuration loading and validation events
- [ ] Test configuration file creation, reading, and updating
- [ ] Ensure configuration changes are applied without EA restart

__Dependencies:__ Sprint 2.5 completed (parameter validation)

### Sprint 2.7: Resource Cleanup Guarantees
- __Objective:__ Ensure proper resource management and cleanup 
- __Activities:__
- [ ] Enhance Cleanup() method to release all resources (file handles, memory)
- [ ] Implement destructor improvements for proper object cleanup
- [ ] Add resource leak detection and reporting
- [ ] Test cleanup during normal deinitialization and error conditions
- [ ] Verify no open file handles or memory leaks after EA removal
- [ ] Log cleanup operations for audit purposes

__Dependencies:__ All previous sprints completed

## Integration and Testing Activities

- [ ] Integrate all components with proper error handling
- [ ] Test full initialization sequence with various configurations
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases
- [ ] Confirm directory creation and file logging functionality
- [ ] Perform resource cleanup testing on deinitialization
- [ ] Ensure no memory leaks or resource issues

### Tests

- [ ] Compile and verify no errors with all includes
- [ ] Test directory creation in different environments
- [ ] Verify file-based logging with log rotation
- [ ] Test parameter validation with invalid inputs
- [ ] Confirm configuration file support works correctly
- [ ] Validate resource cleanup and leak prevention

## Estimated Effort

- Total Phases: 7 discrete sprints with multiple activities each
- Primary Focus: Enhanced reliability, audit capability, and resource management
- Testing Emphasis: Error handling, file operations, and configuration management

This decomposition ensures that Sprint 2 builds systematically on the Sprint 1 foundation, delivering enhanced reliability and audit capabilities ready for future trading logic implementation.
