## Sprint 3 (User Story 3.1): Integration Ready & Performance

### Overview

Sprint 3 completes the Core EA Framework Setup by focusing on performance optimization, integration readiness, and comprehensive documentation to prepare for dashboard integration work.

### Sprint 3.1: Performance Optimization & Memory Management

**Objective:** Optimize EA performance and implement robust memory management

**Activities:**

- [ ] Profile initialization and cleanup performance using MQL5 GetMicrosecondCount()
- [ ] Optimize file I/O operations (buffer sizing, async where possible)
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
- [ ] Add memory usage tracking and reporting in logs
- [ ] Optimize directory creation to check existence before attempting creation
- [ ] Benchmark configuration file loading times and optimize
- [ ] Test performance under high-frequency operations
- [ ] Validate memory usage stays within reasonable bounds

**Dependencies:** Sprint 2 completed (all core functionality implemented)

### Sprint 3.2: Cross-Version Compatibility & Robustness

This is not needed - at most it might be useful to have a build version and OS log in case of failures on other setups.

**Objective:** Ensure compatibility across MT5 versions and improve robustness

**Activities:**

- [ ] Test compatibility with MT5 build versions (current and legacy)
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for missing features in older builds
- [ ] Add build version detection and feature availability checks
- [ ] Test on different operating systems (Windows variants)
- [ ] Validate Unicode and locale handling for international users
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for file system limitations
- [ ] Test with different broker server configurations
- [ ] Verify functionality with various symbol naming conventions

**Dependencies:** Sprint 3.1 completed (performance optimized)

### Sprint 3.3: Comprehensive Documentation & Code Quality

Most or all of this is probably not needed.  Review and check that there isn't something useful that I can pull out.

**Objective:** Complete documentation and ensure code maintainability

**Activities:**

- [ ] Add comprehensive inline documentation to all classes and methods
- [ ] Create technical architecture document for future developers
- [ ] Document all configuration parameters with examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
- [ ] Implement code review checklist compliance
- [ ] Add method and class complexity metrics
- [ ] Ensure consistent coding standards throughout codebase
- [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation

**Dependencies:** Sprint 3.2 completed (compatibility verified)

---

### Sprint 3.4: Integration Testing & Validation

Review these requirements to what can be dropped - some are useful while others appear superfluous.

**Objective:** Prepare for integration with dashboard components

**Activities:**

- [ ] Create mock SuperSlopeDashboard integration points
- [ ] Test EA behavior with various initialization scenarios
- [ ] Validate thread safety for multi-component integration
- [ ] Create integration test suite for dashboard connectivity
- [ ] Test configuration sharing between EA and dashboard components
- [ ] Verify logging coordination between components
- [ ] Perform stress testing with rapid configuration changes
- [ ] Create integration acceptance criteria

**Dependencies:** Sprint 3.3 completed (documentation ready)
