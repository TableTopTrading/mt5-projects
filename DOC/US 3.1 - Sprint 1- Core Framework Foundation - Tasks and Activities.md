## Overview
Sprint 1 focuses on establishing the fundamental infrastructure for the Equity Curve Signal EA, ensuring it can initialize correctly on demo accounts and Strategy Tester with proper safety checks, directory management, and logging.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Create EquityCurveSignalEA.mq5 Skeleton
**Activities:**
- [x] Create new file `MQL5/Experts/MyProjects/EquityCurveSignalEA.mq5`
- [x] Add standard MQL5 EA properties (copyright, version, strict mode)
- [x] Include necessary header files (e.g., CEquityCurveController)
- [x] Implement basic event handlers: OnInit(), OnDeinit(), OnTick()
- [x] Add global controller object instantiation
- [x] Ensure compilation without errors (failed - but looks like it may be due to placeholder code so will proceed)

**Dependencies:** None (foundational file)

### 2. Implement CEquityCurveController Class Structure
**Activities:**
- [x] Create header file `MQL5/Includes/MyProjects/EquityCurve/CEquityCurveController.mqh`
- [x] Define class with private members: m_initialized (bool), m_log_path (string), m_output_path (string)
- [x] Implement constructor and destructor
- [x] Add public methods: Initialize(), ValidateAccountType(), SetupDirectories(), ConfigureLogging(), Cleanup()
- [x] Add IsInitialized() getter method
- [x] Ensure proper access modifiers and MQL5 compliance

**Dependencies:** EA skeleton file created first

### 3. Add Account Type Validation Logic
**Activities:**
- [ ] Implement ValidateAccountType() method in CEquityCurveController
- [ ] Use AccountInfoInteger(ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE) to check account type
- [ ] Add logic to allow only ACCOUNT_TRADE_MODE_DEMO and Strategy Tester
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling with clear messages
- [ ] Log validation results for audit trail
- [ ] Test with different account types to ensure restrictions work

**Dependencies:** CEquityCurveController class structure in place

### 4. Set Up Basic Logging Framework
**Activities:**
- [ ] Implement ConfigureLogging() method
- [ ] Create log file with timestamped naming (e.g., EquityCurve_YYYYMMDD.log)
- [ ] Add log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) with prefixing
- [ ] Implement LogInitializationParameters() to record all init values
- [ ] Ensure log files are stored in appropriate directory
- [ ] Add error handling for file I/O operations
- [ ] Test logging functionality with sample messages

**Dependencies:** Directory management system ready (for log file paths)

### 5. Create Directory Management System
**Activities:**
- [ ] Implement SetupDirectories() method in CEquityCurveController
- [ ] Use FileCreate() or similar MQL5 functions to create directories
- [ ] Create necessary paths: /Files/EquityCurveSignals/Output/, /Files/EquityCurveSignals/Logs/, /Files/EquityCurveSignals/Configuration/
- [ ] Add error checking and reporting for directory creation failures
- [ ] Ensure directories are created with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Log directory creation events for audit purposes

**Dependencies:** Logging framework partially implemented for error reporting

## Integration and Testing Activities
- [ ] Integrate all components in OnInit() method of main EA file
- [ ] Test full initialization sequence in Strategy Tester
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid account types
- [ ] Confirm directory creation and log file generation
- [ ] Perform cleanup testing on deinitialization
- [ ] Ensure no memory leaks or resource issues

## Estimated Effort
- Total Tasks: 5 main components with multiple activities each
- Primary Focus: Safety and reliability through validation and logging
- Testing Emphasis: Account restriction compliance and file system operations

This task breakdown ensures that Sprint 1 delivers a solid, safe foundation for the EA framework, ready for future enhancements in subsequent sprints.
